# UWPcrudapp
This Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a RESTful API. The application manages a collection of products, allowing users to interact with the product data through a simple and intuitive interface.

# What is CRUD App?
CRUD means Create, Read, Delete, Update. From this definition, it’s clear that CRUD is closely related to databases and data storage. CRUD is the simplest form to interact with tables and documents, and it provides you with a representation of the database itself as it is. This means that any app that uses these methods is CRUD software. This begs the question, are there other ways to interact with data? By definition, CRUD itself is limited to primitive operations. But you can do other operations to aggregate, manipulate and represent data in completely different ways. For example, CRUD software can provide you with ways to interact with each individual table within a database. Alternatively, you could create REST API endpoints or even app screens that load all consituent tables in one place. Therefore, you can spice up your CRUD software with additional methods that aren’t just pure CRUD.

# Create
Create allows you to add new rows/records to a database/table or other persistent storage. If the record does not exist, the create operation adds it to the database.
# Read
Read is the operation that allows us to see the recipe we just created. It does not alter data. It simply displays it. Read consists of a function that queries our database and fetches all our records, in this case, recipes. We can tailor our queries to pull back all recipes, or only recipes of a particular type (for example,, vegan recipes). We can also pull back a single recipe if we have a UID (unique identifier).
# Update
Update is the operation that allows us to modify existing data and records within a table. This enables users to update a single field within a record or multiple fields at once. It is also possible to update multiple records at once too.
# Delete
Delete is the operation that allows us to remove records from a table using a CRUD web application
